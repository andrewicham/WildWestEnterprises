# WildWestEnterprises
The goal of this project is to create a web form simulating an e-commerce site, specifically with "wild west" items. This is done using JQuery (including validation and JQuery UI plugins), HTML5, and CSS3. This project is solely meant to practice front end web development, so no backend technologies are used.
